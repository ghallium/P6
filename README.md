Hi everyone !

Here is the sixth project for OpenClassrooms web developer program where i have to make an API for a web app about hot sauces. The idea is that any
user can add/edit/delete a hot sauce while other users can like/dislike it. The app uses Express, Node.JS, MongoDB and other packages like JSonWebToken
and Multer.
